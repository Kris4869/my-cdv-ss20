**Examples**

1. stock prediction
stock prediction is bascially statistical, althought there might be more advanced ones that are used by investment companies. It takes various data in the stock market, including price of each stocks in every few seconds/hours/days, as well as other data such as the number of deals.... Then it generates predictions based on different statisticaal formulas.

2. weather report
The weather report uses data from many advanced machines such as sensor data from setellitea and ground observation center. Then proceeded by very complex algorithm to predict the future weather. 

3. alipay loan
Alipay loan "Ma Yi Hua Bei", is the loan many people using alipay can apply for. It usually loans several hundreds to tens of thousands, depends on each person's alipay credit, so that people can make payment (most commonly, buy things on taobao) and last alipay pay the bill first, then pay back to alipay moth by moth with a certain interest rate. That alipay credit is a prediction to a person's future pay back ability, and decides whether / how much alipay can lend him money. As the company plays a role in many financial fields in China, it can collect data of everyone's financial behavior and evaluate people.

**Thoughts**

These three examples has very distinct differents: the stock market is purly man made - fron the rules to every trade are based on human behavior, everyone's decision can affect the system. On the contrart the weather system are completely governed by laws of physics, that is, purly natural. But the two are both famous one their unreliability (lol). On the contrary, the alipay prediction are very accurate (after all, if it is inacurate the company will shut down this business long time ago). All of the cases involoves huge amount of data, some uses statistical ways some uses algorithm (I suppose Alipay uses both), and it involves both man made system and natural system. But the accuracy does not depend on any of them, instead, it is depend on whether the system contains non-linearity (chaos). The butterfly effect is a very vivid example. A non-linear chaotic system means that a tiny difference in the initial value will result in huge inaccuracy in the outcome. Unless we can achieve infinite accuracy in the initial value, the long term result will not be reliable.
Big data does not solve this problem at all. 
Yet in linear system big data performs very well. For example, The alipay evaluation contain very significant linearity, the wealthier one is, the more likey one can pay back the loans (which could be measure by how much one spend on taobao), if one has been using the loan service for a long time and has been paying back on time, the more likely one can pay back next time .....

The sad thing is, for the prediction of linear systems, big data does not provide fundamental change (banks have beening operating well long before computer exists), but for the systems human are very eager to predict, they are mostly chaotic.
