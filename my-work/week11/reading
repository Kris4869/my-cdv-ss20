Both facebook and cambridge analytics showed us a very serious problem. Although many may feel uncomfortable about Cambridge Analytics' behavior, we could hardly say it is not legal, in fact, we can hardly find or even invent laws for such behavior, it is very hard to define what is manipulating democracy by social median and big data, and even hard to find a proper punishment. However, the source of this problem, Facebook, has a lot of things that we can deal with. The reason that Facebook behaves like this is the monopoly status in the market. We can see that laws can hardly regulated such companies, I watched the talk of Zacburg any many congressmen have no idea of what facebook is doing and what is its business.
For users, they have no choice but using it even if they know FAcebook is stealing and abusing their privacy; Facebook also lacks competators to monitor its behavior, which is usually more effective than law enforcement agencies. Therefore basically we can hardly do things if the companies stays in the current status.
Therefore one possible solution discussed by many is to take those monopoly apart to several small companies, to create competators and minimize their monopoly power, so that they cannot have such power to manipulate user's privacy. This type of action has been done at least one in the states' history I think, on Rockefeller Group, if I remember correctly.
