1. Raw data

What do we mean when when say raw data? After chapter 2's discussion of subjectivity and objectivity, we can give a shortcut definitionï¼š raw data is objective data collected from a certain field for further analysis. Yet as the article mentioned we need to firstly imagine the data as "data" to use it, therefore as long as data appears in sue, it is not raw anymore. All the cleaning, filtering, and the later algorithm design process make the raw data never exist in application.
In the following part the author argues those process means that big data is interpretive thus may not reflect the truth. Yet although big data has phylosophical flaws, the real problem is not here: after all in practice we can see its achievement (using big data to predict the number of customer requirements to reasonably allocate resource, as well as other management work' using it to train AI , taobao recommandations...). Yet the real problem hides in the end of Chapter 1. There the author exeplifies Ford and its assembly lines. Fordism offers good products but in the middle throw away important information. Big data is similar, it is a short cut for us to get prediction of a system, but it doesn't help us to understand the essence (mechanism) of a system as it treats the system as a black box. (It is why everyone uses AI but no one understands it fully)
(yet this flaw does not mean that big data is bad, complex system involves non-linearity that human cannot, and perhaps, can never undertand, and big data might be the best solution)



2. Accounting tools ...

I have quite an understanding of these words since I've been playing in the stock market for a while, and there is a more concrete example of that paragraph that is more close to our life:
In the finance field there are a lot of statistical methods that predicts the trend of a stock's price (MCAD, KDJ, BOLL ...), based on "relatively small amount of big data", (such as previous price in a range of days, highest price ,lowest price, average lines, the concept one stock belongs to...). Then people begin to find that many methods performs way better than they should be. And the reason is quite simple: people believe in the result. When such a method predicts that the price of a stock is about to rise, people believe it and start to buy more, in doing so making the price actually rise (and vice versa). Therefore a measurement tool actually influences the object. Big Data performs similar result, although the logic might be different in detail. But it is destined to happen when big data is used to measure human society because, like financial system, the entire human society is consensus-based, and the tools are changing that consensus.



3. twitter data..

As the article mentioned, Twitter users != people. Besides the account issue mentioned, Twittter data have strong bias in certain questions. As an online media, it automatically filters out people above a certain age that a not accustomed to these new electron device. 
The article also mentions the data source of twitter may not represent the population, and there are some doubts on its API. Yet I don't think it is a problen for big data. Ever since the birth of statistics there are conflicts on "representative data". Big data as a method does not responsible for it. On the other hand, if we purposed seek for "representative data", isn't it that the data now is subjective and may not reflect the truth?




4. Privacy

Theoritically no, and the reason is not tedious moral propagation but simple economic principle: if one wants to use my resource (information) to make profit for him, then I need a share. But it lives in theory anyways, the public nature means that it is neve going to happen.



Last thought on chapter 5 6.

BIg data is now a resource / capital and resource /capital has the tendency to be monopolied. And we can see that the large companies are doing that. The four parts in the society, market, law, norms and achitecture are connected, and market can affect laws for sure. I'm afraid that with the capitalize of big data, the right and wrong will gradually fall to the back of the "big men" 's mind
