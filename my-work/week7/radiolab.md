**Right to be forgotten**

1. try to come up with a set of guidelines how public records/data should be dealt with -- and/or discuss the difficulties of this task.

If the guideline means policy and law:
I would say that no guidelines in terms of policy and law that restricts the access of such information, or compel deleteion of such information, should be done. (I'm saying the news report and private media, but not offical record in the court database)
since the information involved is published legally, it is not a matter of privacy. Any execuse in terms of protecting privacy contradicts what privacy is in the logic of law. what technology does is only to speed up finding the legitimate information. A thought experiment would further clarify this problem: 
consider a man Bob just gets out of prison, and his victims remembers him throughtout the years, the mintue Bob gets out the prison his victim shout on the Internet and post blogs to every public channel about the crime of Bob. Should the victim be sentenced with any crime? CLearly not. The Internet is just a replacement of that victim and serves the same function in the view of public.
I really like the sentence in the poscast "we cannot completely delete our past, and people need to learn to forgive wtihout forget", it seems the only we to work out this problem. If there is any guidleine I think it is the people to be guide but not technology. Let people realize a man's past may not represent what he is now, is the only solution without side effect.
Well I still need to admit this way of thinking is in a non-human like pure neutral point of view to maintain the continousity of law and social value about what is justified, yet if I was the criminal I also want my profile deleted.

Or we don't reveal the detailed information in the reports at all in the first place.


2. can you think of other situations for similar kinds of dilemmas?

Not only crimes, but there are many information of the past on the internet that we don't want other people to findout. Say previous edncational expreience, in China if one took a terrible college he might be discriminated in real life. 



**The Daily The End of Privacy as we know it?**

1. weigh the benefits and risks of a system like ClearView

It increase the speed to catch criminials and make the community safer. But if it is use in any other form it offers intensive threats to prople' privacy.
It also alarm me when the reporter found the company can filter her out and monitor anf manipulate it. It means that if the police dependent on it too much, the company can also protect criminals by controling the data.

I find this company very interesting so I tried to get more information. Now the service is also used by Canada and Austrilia police, what's more, the clients' list were stolen recently.

Even if the company keeps it promise of only serving the law enforcement department in democratic countries, the company is still the targets of hackers to acquire the service.


2. which aspects do you find particularly problematic & how might we regulate undertakings like this?

The root problem is how to treat the "public" data individual posts on social media. It is a probelm that has been discussed many times in the prevous readings and other materials, and I finally see one example of it becoming a real threat instead of theoritical problem. The central solution is still to redefine what a "public data on personal social media" means, a change in thinking and language is firstly needed, say a new word between current meaning of "private" and "public", then have different regulations on them.
