					Data: Biased Collection
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						<h4>Biased Data</h4>
						<p>In statistics, sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others. It results in a biased sample, a non-random sample of a population (or non-human factors) in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.If this is not accounted for, results can be erroneously attributed to the phenomenon under study rather than to the method of sampling.</p>
						<h4>Function</h4> 
						<p>A biased sampling can also be used on purpose to change the behavior of the data. By changing the "truth" that the data shows this method indirectedly affect people's decision.</p>
						<p>This method may not be discovered by the public at first, but when the observable fact deviates too much from the data, people become suspicious</p>

					Data: R0 recalculation
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						<h4>R0 recalculation</h4>
						<p>In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number(R0) of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. It is very useful as a mathmetical guidance for predicting the severeness of the disease and controling the disease's spreading.</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>Sampling the R0 involves lots of mathmetical and statistical techniques common citizens, so it is relatively easy to intentionally sample a bad R0 so that the disease looks less scary.</p>
						<p>Yet since it is very complicated, you also cannot gurantanee how effective it should be</p>

					<span class="tooltiptext">
						<h4>Weighted Average</h4>
						<p>The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.</p>
						<p>It has been reported that the old are more easily to get infected and have severer symptom, yet if we intentionally put more weight on the young </p>
						<p>It is relative safe to use this method since the public cannot understand the detail of those statistics, yet still when the observable fact deviates too much from the data, people become suspicious</p>

						<h4>Redesign Standards</h4>
						<p>Data collection standart is a very broad subject and different fields have their own guidelines. The one that we are most familiar with is probably random collection, but simply as it seems, the way to achieve it could be very complicated: does random mean we randomly go to some hospitals in a city to ask for the situation?</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>We can design some mallicious collection standards that are intented to misguide the public, but it is a relatively huge workload. Also, if many find our standard are too different from the global one, they may get suspicious</p>

					Stats: Regression
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						<h4>Regression</h4>
						<p>In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable  and one or more independent variables.</p>
						
						<p>Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. </p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation.</p>
						<p>Therefore we could intentionally use regression to create fake relationship that makes the prediction of the disease looks better, yet calculation is a great task but it is relative safe</p>

				<button class = "tooltip" id="Interpolation">
					Stats: Interpolation
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						<h4>Interpolation</h4>
						<p>Similar to regression, Interpolation is also a way to find relationshp between two varibles, In the mathematical modelling interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable. It is often required to interpolate, i.e., estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.</p>
						<p>Therefore, Interpolation plays an important role in deriving the prediction function of the disease from the data</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>It behaves somehow similiar to regression. They are both medium cost but probably the safest tools: due to high knowledge background requirement, the public usually cannot doubt this process. Yet they are hard to use.</p>

						<h4>Public Attention Redirection</h4>
						<p>I thas been well studied that the attention of the public changes very quickly and can be easily leaded, some people use this feature to lead the public to forget certain things </p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>Sometimes we spread affairs of celebrities, other times we  It is ofen effective, but you need lots of workers to handle this in social media and traditional media</p>

						<h4>Online Propaganda</h4>
						<p>Propaganda is communication that is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented. Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations, the media, and individuals can also produce propaganda.In the 20th century, the term propaganda has often been associated with a manipulative approach</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>We can post propaganda on the Internet frequently about how we work hard to deal with the disease and how effective it is, so that people will trust us and less worring.</p>

						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>We can work with experts to let them say some conforting things about the disease, but it is temporary, when more people are infected the public will find the truth</p>

						<h4>Speech Regulation</h4>
						<p>in some countries  freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the  Constitution, but some countries other controls public speech. In the world of Internet it is even more easier and effective to control public speech and attitudes with big data and AI</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>The simplest way is to delete what we don't want people to see from social media, it does not cost much but it may irritate the public</p>

						<h4>Arrest</h4>
						<p>An arrest is the act of apprehending and taking a person into custody (legal protection or control), usually because the person has been suspected of or observed committing a crime. After being taken into custody, the person can be questioned further and/or charged. An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system.</p>
						<h4>Function</h4>
						<p>We can co-operate with the police to arrest those who spreads speeches or does certain actions that cause the public to panic or untrust the government, it does not cost much computational power, but the public may responds more severely.</p>
